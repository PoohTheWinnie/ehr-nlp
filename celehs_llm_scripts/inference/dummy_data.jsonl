Patient has history of right upper lobe wedge\nresection with benign findings.\n\nCOMPARISON:  Whole body PET-CT ___.\n\nPROCEDURE:  The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the\npatient, and written informed consent was obtained.  A preprocedure timeout\nwas performed verifying three patient identifiers and the nature of the\nprocedure to be performed.  Patient was placed prone on the CT table, and\nplaced under general anesthesia for the entire duration of the procedure. \nInitial non-contrast CT images were obtained through the lower chest, which\ndemonstrated the presence of an 11 mm nodule in the right lower lobe\ncostophrenic angle.  In addition, a new 6 mm nodule is noted to be adjacent to\nthe mass, not seen on prior PET-CT.The skin overlying the right back was\nprepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  Under direct CT fluoroscopic\nguidance, a 20-gauge biopsy needle system was advanced to the two adjacent\nright lower lobe nodules, and a single core biopsy specimen was obtained and\nsent for cytology and pathology analysis.  Initial cytology found the tissue\nto be highly suspicious for carcinoma.  Post-procedure limited CT immediately\npost biopsy demonstrated a small amount of perilesional hemorrhage, which\nsignificantly obscured the lesion in the right lower lobe.  There was no\nevidence of pneumothorax.  The needle guide was removed, and a 10 minute\ndelayed chest CT was obtained.  10 minute delayed limited CT of the lower\nchest demonstrated persistence of the stable perilesional hemorrhage, which\nobscured the lesion, rendering it impossible to proceed with the\nradiofrequency ablation.  There was no evidence of pneumothorax on the 10\nminute delayed scan.  Plan is to bring the patient back in four weeks after\nthe bleeding has cleared for radiofrequency ablation.  Dry sterile dressing\nwas placed.  The patient tolerated the procedure well, with no complications\nevident at the time of the procedure.  The attending radiologist, Dr.\n___, was present and supervising throughout the procedure.\n\nPRE-PROCEDURE IMAGING FINDINGS:  Left basilar subsegmental atelectasis.  Mild\nright basilar subsegmental atelectasis.  In the superior segment of the right\nlower lobe is noted an 8 mm nodule, unchanged since prior PET-CT.  In the\nright lower lobe costophrenic angle is again seen an 11 mm nodule, similar in\nsize to prior PET-CT.  However, there is a new 6 mm nodule anterior to the 11\nmm nodule, this 6 mm nodule appears new and most likely represents interval\ngrowth of malignancy.  Significant coronary atherosclerosis again noted. \nModerate calcific atherosclerosis of the aorta.  Elevation of the right\nhemidiaphragm again seen.\n\nPOST-PROCEDURE IMAGING FINDINGS:  Again visualized is bibasilar subsegmental\natelectasis.  Small amount of perilesional hemorrhage is seen in the right\nlower lobe, obscuring the two small nodules.  Again visualized is coronary\natherosclerosis and aortic calcific atherosclerosis.  Again noted is the 8 mm\nsuperior segment right lower lobe nodule, unchanged since prior PET-CT.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\nTechnically successful CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of right lower lobe\nnodules, with new satellite nodule since prior PET-CT.  Post-procedure limited\nCT demonstrated small amount of perilesional hemorrhage, which obscured the\nright lower lobe lesion, not possible to proceed with radiofrequency ablation\ntoday.

Compared to the ___ MRI, there is a new small right sided disk protrusion\nat L1-2, at the level of the proximal right neural foramen, with mild, if any,\nright neural foraminal narrowing.\n3. Degenerative disease at L4-5 and L5-S1 appears unchanged compared to ___,\nas detailed above.\n4. Bone marrow signal remains diffusely low, which most often represents red\nmarrow reconversion in the setting of anemia, smoking, or chronic systemic\nillness. More rarely, this may be secondary to an infiltrative process. Please\ncorrelate with clinical history and laboratory data.\n", "question": "Given the fact that this is a patient's doctor's note, is this patient a current smoker, past smoker, or has never smoked before?", "answer": "I don't know."}
{"sample_idx": 96, "context": "REASON FOR EXAM:  ___ man with melanoma, evaluate disease.\n\nTECHNIQUE:  Multi-detector helical scanning of the chest was obtained from\nthoracic inlet to upper abdomen in supine position without administration of\nIV contrast, but with administration of oral contrast.

Even though this nodule\nmight be inflammatory, due to patient history, follow-up in three months is\nrecommended.  \nThere are also multiple punctate centrilobular, upper lobe predominant,\nground-glass opacities, which should be correlated with smoking habit of the\npatient and might be due to respiratory bronchiolitis.  All the following\nnodules are stable since ___ and not concerning for malignancy\n(series 4, images 44, 65, 69, 74, 85).  Area of tubular bronchiectasis and\nparenchymal scarring next to the site of wedge resection right middle lobe is\nunchanged since ___.  Lingular and right lower lobe granulomas are\nstable (4:181, 200).\n\nIMPRESSION:\n\n1.  New 3 mm ground-glass opacity in the left lower lobe warrants follow-up in\nthree months to assess interval changes.  The remainder of the nodules is\nstable since ___ and not concerning for malignancy.  \n\n2.  Accentuation of the centrilobular core structure, upper lobe predominant,\nwith small ground-glass opacities is compatible with respiratory bronchiolitis\nand it should be correlated with smoking habit of the patient.\n\n3.  There is no peripheral or central lymphadenopathy.  \n\n4.
